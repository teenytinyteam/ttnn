One Day in the Life of a Young Explorer
Morning Light
The sun rises over the hills. Birds sing in the trees. A young boy named Tom wakes up. He opens his eyes and smiles. Today is a new day.

Tom gets out of bed. He puts on his shirt and pants. He walks to the kitchen. His mother is there. She says, "Good morning, Tom."

"Good morning, Mom," Tom replies.

He sits at the table. His father brings him a plate. On it are eggs and toast. Tom eats his breakfast. He drinks a glass of milk.

After eating, Tom brushes his teeth. He washes his face. He combs his hair. He is ready for the day.

The Journey Begins
Tom grabs his backpack. Inside are a map, a notebook, and a pencil. He also has a snack and a bottle of water.

"Be careful," his mother says.

"I will," Tom replies.

He steps outside. The air is fresh. The sky is blue. He walks down the path. Flowers bloom along the way. Bees buzz near the flowers.

Tom sees a butterfly. It flutters by. He smiles and follows it for a while. Then he looks at his map.

"I will go to the big tree near the river," he says.

Into the Woods
The path leads into the woods. Trees stand tall on both sides. Leaves rustle in the wind. Birds chirp above.

Tom walks carefully. He listens to the sounds. A squirrel runs across the path. Tom stops and watches it.

He takes out his notebook. He writes: "Saw a squirrel running fast."

As he walks, he sees different plants. Some have red berries. Others have big green leaves. He takes notes about them.

Suddenly, he hears a sound. It's a stream. Water flows over rocks. He kneels and touches the water. It's cool and clear.

He drinks some water from his bottle. Then he eats his snack. It's an apple and a cookie.

The Big Tree
After resting, Tom continues his journey. He climbs a small hill. At the top, he sees the big tree. Its branches spread wide. Its leaves are dark green.

He walks to the tree and sits under it. He takes out his notebook and writes: "Reached the big tree. It's very old and tall."

Tom looks around. He sees birds flying. He sees ants on the ground. He draws pictures of them.

He hears a rustling sound. He turns and sees a rabbit. It hops near him, then runs away.

Tom smiles and writes: "Saw a rabbit near the tree."

By the River
Tom walks to the river. The water flows gently. He sees fish swimming. He throws a small stone into the water. It makes ripples.

He sits on a rock and watches the river. He feels calm and happy.

He takes out his map and marks the spot. He writes: "River near big tree. Peaceful place."

Heading Home
The sun begins to set. The sky turns orange and pink. Tom packs his things.

He walks back through the woods. Shadows grow longer. He hears owls hooting.

He reaches the path to his home. Lights shine from the windows. He walks faster.

At the door, his mother opens it. "Welcome back," she says.

"I'm home," Tom replies.

He takes off his shoes and washes his hands. He sits at the table. His father serves dinner.

They eat and talk. Tom tells them about his day. He shows his notebook.

"You had quite an adventure," his father says.

"Yes," Tom smiles.

Night Falls
After dinner, Tom takes a bath. He puts on his pajamas. He brushes his teeth.

He lies in bed and looks at the ceiling. He thinks about his day.

He whispers, "Thank you for the adventure."

He closes his eyes and falls asleep.
